A simple *Hello World!* program written in OpenFOAM's framework.

In all honesty, apart from using **wmake** for compiling,
and the **Info** stream for printing to the Terminal,
there is nothing really OpenFOAM-ish about this one.

This should work with almost all versions of OpenFOAM.
Tested with:
* OpenFOAM-4.0
* OpenFOAM-4.1
